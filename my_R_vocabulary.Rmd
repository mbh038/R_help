This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Downloading Files
```{r,eval=FALSE}
#create sub-directory of the working dir called "data" if one does not exist already

if(!file.exists("data")){
        dir.create("data")
}

#download a data file as csv in the "data" dir

#on Mac, need method="curl" if url starts with https:

fileURL<-"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/dz54-2aru/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
download.file(fileURL,destfile="./data/cameras.csv")
list.files("./data")

#include date of download
datedownloaded<-date()
datedownloaded
```
##Reading local flat files into R
read.table - can be slow, watch out for big files
expects TAB delimited files, so this gives an error:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cameraData<-read.table("./data/cameras.csv")
```
This works:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cameraData<-read.table("./data/cameras.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
```
or use  - read.csv - automatically sets  *sep=","* and  *header=TRUE*
so this works too:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
cameraData<-read.csv("./data/cameras.csv")
```
